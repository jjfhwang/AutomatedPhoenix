# AutomatedPhoenix: Decentralized Crypto Exchange Automation Reimagined

AutomatedPhoenix is a cutting-edge Python-based project designed to automate trading activities within decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (DEXs). It provides a robust framework for API-driven login, NFT-gated data collection, and algorithmic DeFi trade execution via smart contracts, enabling users to create and deploy sophisticated trading strategies in a decentralized and secure manner.

This project addresses the growing need for automated tools within the DeFi space. Manually monitoring DEXs and executing trades can be time-consuming and inefficient. AutomatedPhoenix eliminates these challenges by providing a suite of tools that automate the entire trading lifecycle. It allows users to access real-time market data, analyze trading opportunities, and execute trades based on pre-defined algorithmic strategies. The NFT-gated data collection feature provides exclusive access to premium datasets, enhancing the accuracy and profitability of trading algorithms. The core focus is on providing developers with the flexibility and power to build advanced trading bots tailored to specific DEXs and market conditions.

The value proposition of AutomatedPhoenix lies in its decentralized nature, security, and customizability. By leveraging smart contracts for trade execution, it eliminates the need for centralized intermediaries, reducing counterparty risk and ensuring transparency. The API-driven login allows for seamless integration with various DEX platforms, while the modular architecture allows developers to easily extend the functionality of the framework and adapt it to their specific trading requirements. Furthermore, AutomatedPhoenix prioritizes security through robust auditing and vulnerability testing practices.

Key Features:

*   **API-Driven Login:** Seamlessly integrates with popular DEXs through their respective APIs, supporting authentication and authorization for secure access to user accounts. (e.g., uses the `web3.py` library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and the appropriate DEX's API wrappers for specific functionalities like order placement and cancellation).
*   **NFT-Gated Data Collection:** Provides exclusive access to premium datasets through NFT ownership, enabling users to gain a competitive edge by analyzing proprietary market information. (Implements ERC-721 token verification to ensure only NFT holders can access the designated data endpoints. Data is retrieved using libraries like `requests` and processed using `pandas`).
*   **Algorithmic DeFi Trade Execution:** Employs customizable algorithms for automated trade execution based on predefined trading strategies, including support for limit orders, market orders, and stop-loss orders. (Trading logic is implemented using Python's scientific computing libraries like `NumPy` and `SciPy`. Strategies can be defined using custom Python classes and configured through a JSON-based configuration file).
*   **Smart Contract Integration:** Executes trades through smart contracts, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability. (The `web3.py` library is used to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Contract ABI files are required for deploying and interacting with DEX smart contracts).
*   **Real-time Data Streaming:** Continuously streams real-time market data from various DEXs, providing users with up-to-date information for informed trading decisions. (Utilizes websocket connections via the `websockets` library to subscribe to real-time data feeds from DEXs. Data is parsed and processed asynchronously using `asyncio`).
*   **Backtesting and Simulation:** Allows users to backtest trading strategies on historical data and simulate trading performance before deploying them to live markets. (Backtesting is implemented using historical data retrieved from DEX APIs and stored in a local database or CSV files. Performance metrics are calculated using libraries like `scikit-learn`).

Technology Stack:

*   **Python:** The primary programming language for building the automation framework.
*   **web3.py:** Python library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts.
*   **requests:** Python library for making HTTP requests to DEX APIs.
*   **websockets:** Python library for establishing WebSocket connections for real-time data streaming.
*   **NumPy:** Python library for numerical computing and array manipulation.
*   **pandas:** Python library for data analysis and manipulation.
*   **scikit-learn:** Python library for machine learning and data analysis (used for backtesting).
*   **Solidity (optional):** Smart contract language for deploying and interacting with DEX contracts (only required if deploying custom contracts).

Installation:

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/AutomatedPhoenix.git`
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd AutomatedPhoenix`
3.  Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
4.  Activate the virtual environment:
    *   On Linux/macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
    *   On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
5.  Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Configuration:

The project relies on environment variables for sensitive information and configuration settings. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and define the following variables:

*   `DEX_API_KEY`: Your API key for accessing the DEX API.
*   `WALLET_ADDRESS`: Your Ethereum wallet address.
*   `PRIVATE_KEY`: Your Ethereum wallet private key (use with caution and consider hardware wallets).
*   `INFURA_PROJECT_ID`: Your Infura project ID for connecting to the Ethereum network.
*   `NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: Address of the NFT contract for gated data access.
*   `DATA_ENDPOINT_URL`: URL endpoint for accessing the NFT-gated data.

Example `.env` file:

DEX_API_KEY=your_dex_api_key
WALLET_ADDRESS=0xYourWalletAddress
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYourPrivateKey
INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id
NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xNFTContractAddress
DATA_ENDPOINT_URL=https://api.example.com/premiumdata

Usage:

Before running the trading bot, configure the trading strategy by modifying the `config.json` file. This file specifies parameters such as trading pair, trade size, stop-loss percentage, and algorithm parameters.

Example:

python main.py --strategy config.json

This command will launch the trading bot with the specified configuration. The bot will connect to the DEX API, stream real-time market data, and execute trades according to the defined strategy. Detailed logging information will be printed to the console and saved to a log file.

For API documentation, refer to the `docs` directory, which contains detailed information about each module and function within the project.
